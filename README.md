# Bad-Geometry-Dash
A very small project that I threw together for fun. I did not spend much time on it, so it's pretty barebones, but it's functional so yay!

Note: I uploaded this using git LFS as the .exe was too big to drag and drop. Because of this (i think), the game will not work when downloading the entire folder as a zip (the files get compressed to 1kB, probably because GitHub doesn't want me using so much space haha). So, in order to play the game, you must individually download the .exe and .pck files into the same folder, only then will the .exe run properly. Sorry for the inconvinience!!!
